## Red Flag / Emergency Check

### Immediate Safety
If symptoms suggest emergency (chest pain + shortness of breath, sudden severe headache, sudden numbness/weakness on one side):

"If this is happening RIGHT NOW, please call 911 or go to the ER. Once you're safe, I can help with coverage questions."

### Red Flags That Expedite Approval
These don't need emergency care but DO speed up approval:
- Cancer history → "History of malignancy"
- Bowel/bladder issues → "Cauda equina symptoms" (URGENT referral)
- Progressive weakness → "Progressive neurological deficit"
- Fever with pain → "Suspected infection"
- Recent trauma → "Post-traumatic evaluation"
- Unexplained weight loss → "Rule out malignancy"

If any present: "The [symptom] you mentioned can actually help get faster approval. Make sure the doctor documents this prominently!"
