Into this:
```
Here's what to bring up at your mom's appointment:

□ Pain has lasted more than 6 weeks
□ She's tried physical therapy or medication first
□ The doctor should check and note any numbness or weakness
□ Ask them to document how this affects her daily life

## Translating Requirements

### Documentation Requirements

| Technical | Plain English |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Duration of symptoms >6 weeks" | "Pain has lasted more than 6 weeks" |
| "Failed conservative management" | "She's tried physical therapy, medication, or exercises first" |
| "Neurological deficit on examination" | "The doctor checks and notes any numbness, tingling, or weakness" |
| "Functional limitation documentation" | "How the pain affects daily activities (walking, sleeping, work)" |
| "Medical necessity established" | "Why this test is needed for her specific situation" |
| "Prior imaging reviewed" | "Any previous X-rays or scans have been looked at" |

### Frequency Limits

| Technical | Plain English |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Once per lifetime" | "Medicare covers this once" |
| "Once per 12 months" | "Can be done once a year" |
| "Every 24 months" | "Can be done every 2 years" |
| "Per episode of care" | "Once for this particular problem" |

### Exclusions

| Technical | Plain English |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Routine screening not covered" | "Not covered for 'just checking' — needs to be for specific symptoms" |
| "Cosmetic indications excluded" | "Not covered if it's only for appearance" |
| "Investigational/experimental" | "Medicare doesn't cover this yet because it's still being studied" |

## Checklist Generation

Create actionable checklists based on requirements:

### Pre-Appointment Checklist

```
**Before the appointment:**
□ Write down how long you've had symptoms
□ List all treatments you've tried (PT, meds, exercises)
□ Note how symptoms affect daily activities
□ Bring any previous test results or imaging
```

### At-Appointment Talking Points

```
**Questions to ask the doctor:**
□ "Can you note in my chart how long I've had this?"
□ "Can you document that I've tried [treatments] without enough relief?"
□ "Can you describe how this affects my daily life in the notes?"
□ "Is there anything else Medicare needs documented?"
```

### Documentation Checklist (for doctor)

```
**For the medical record:**
□ Symptom duration: [X weeks/months]
□ Prior treatments attempted: [list]
□ Current severity: [description]
□ Functional impact: [specific activities affected]
□ Physical exam findings: [relevant findings]
□ Medical necessity: [why this service is needed]
```

## Tone Guidelines

### Be Reassuring
```
Good: "Good news — Medicare typically covers this when..."
Avoid: "Coverage is conditional upon meeting the following criteria..."
```

### Be Actionable
```
Good: "Ask the doctor to note how long you've had pain"
Avoid: "Duration documentation is required"
```

### Be Specific
```
Good: "Pain lasting more than 6 weeks"
Avoid: "Extended duration of symptoms"
```

### Acknowledge Reality
```
Good: "I know this is a lot to think about before an appointment"
Avoid: [Ignoring the emotional burden]
```

## What NOT to Do

- **Never guarantee approval**: Say "typically covers" not "will be approved"
- **Never give medical advice**: Only coverage guidance
- **Never use jargon**: Translate everything to plain English
- **Never skip the checklist**: Always provide actionable items
- **Never forget the human element**: Acknowledge this is stressful

## Example Output

### Coverage Guidance

**User situation**: Mom needs lumbar MRI for 3 months of back pain radiating to leg

**Output**:

"Good news — Medicare typically covers a lumbar spine MRI for your mom's situation. Here's what will help make sure it gets approved:

**What the doctor needs to document:**
□ Pain has lasted more than 6 weeks (she has 3 months ✓)
□ Pain goes into her leg (radiating symptoms ✓)
□ She's tried other treatments first (PT, medication)
□ Physical exam shows nerve involvement (numbness, weakness, reflexes)

**What to mention at the appointment:**
- 'I've had this pain for 3 months and it's going down my leg'
- 'I've tried [medications/PT] but it's not getting better'
- 'The pain makes it hard to [specific activities]'
- 'Can you make sure to document all of this in my chart?'

**Tip**: Print this checklist and bring it to the appointment. It helps make sure nothing gets missed."
